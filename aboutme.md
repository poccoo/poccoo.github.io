## About Me

I am a **Biostatistics graduate student** with strong applied training in **statistical modeling, real-world data analysis, and programming, along with a solid foundation in biological sciences**. I am seeking roles across **biostatistics, data analysis, biology field research, and laboratory technician positions** that value both quantitative and experimental skills.

I am currently pursuing a **Master of Science in Biostatistics (Theory and Methods Track)** at the **Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health**, with an expected graduation in **May 2026**.

My background combines **rigorous statistical theory** with **hands-on experience working on large, real-world datasets**, including clinical, biomedical, and healthcare-related data.

My background combines **rigorous statistical theory** with **hands-on experience working on large, real-world datasets,** (including clinical, biomedical, and healthcare-related data) as well as **formal coursework and practical training in biology and laboratory research**. Although my primary degree is not in biology, I completed extensive **undergraduate coursework in molecular biology, physiology, and molecular genetics,** alongside corresponding **biology and organic chemistry laboratory training**, and have worked directly in **wet-lab research environments**.

## Industry & Applied Experience

I currently work as a **Research Assistant** at Columbia University / NYSPI, where I analyze **large-scale neuroimaging and clinical datasets** related to Alzheimer’s disease. My role emphasizes **applied statistical analysis and reproducible workflows**, including:

- Regression and **mixed-effects models** for longitudinal and repeated-measures data  
- Mediation and interaction analysis using simulation-based inference  
- Data cleaning, transformation, and analysis in **R and Python**  
- Communicating statistical findings to multidisciplinary teams

Previously, I worked as a **Laboratory Assistant** at the Food Science and Processing Research Center, Shenzhen University, where I gained **hands-on wet-lab experience**. My work included improving **soybean protein extraction** protocols and conducting **comparative protein analysis** using **Ion Exchange HPLC (IEX-HPLC)**, reinforcing my familiarity with experimental design, data collection, and laboratory workflows.

In addition to academic research, I have gained **industry exposure through healthcare consulting (IQVIA)** and data-focused roles, where I worked with structured, real-world datasets under practical constraints such as data quality, timelines, and stakeholder needs. These experiences strengthened my ability to translate quantitative analyses into **actionable insights**.

## Technical Skills & Certification

I have experience across both **dry-lab and wet-lab** settings. On the computational side, I am proficient in **R, Python, SQL, and SAS** and can build end-to-end analytical workflows from raw data to reporting and visualization.

I hold both **SAS Base and SAS Advanced Certifications**, and I am comfortable using **SAS in regulated or industry-standard environments**, particularly for data manipulation, statistical analysis, and reporting.

**Key technical strengths include:**

- Regression modeling and statistical inference  

- Longitudinal and real-world data analysis  

- Data wrangling and validation  

- Reproducible analysis pipelines and clear reporting
