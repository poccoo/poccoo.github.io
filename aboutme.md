## About Me

I am a **Biostatistics graduate student** with strong applied training in **statistical modeling, real-world data analysis, and programming**, and a clear interest in **industry-facing roles** such as **Biostatistician, Data Analyst, and Quantitative Analyst**.

I am currently pursuing a **Master of Science in Biostatistics (Theory and Methods Track)** at the **Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health**, with an expected graduation in **May 2026**.

My background combines **rigorous statistical theory** with **hands-on experience working on large, real-world datasets**, including clinical, biomedical, and healthcare-related data.


## Industry & Applied Experience

I currently work as a **Research Assistant** at Columbia University / NYSPI, where I analyze **large-scale neuroimaging and clinical datasets** related to Alzheimer’s disease. My role emphasizes **applied statistical analysis and reproducible workflows**, including:

- Regression and **mixed-effects models** for longitudinal and repeated-measures data  
- Mediation and interaction analysis using simulation-based inference  
- Data cleaning, transformation, and analysis in **R and Python**  
- Communicating statistical findings to multidisciplinary teams

In addition to academic research, I have gained **industry exposure through healthcare consulting (IQVIA)** and data-focused roles, where I worked with structured, real-world datasets under practical constraints such as data quality, timelines, and stakeholder needs. These experiences strengthened my ability to translate quantitative analyses into **actionable insights**.


## Technical Skills & Certification

I am proficient in **R, Python, SQL, and SAS**, with experience building end-to-end analytical workflows from raw data to reporting and visualization.

I hold both **SAS Base and SAS Advanced Certifications**, and I am comfortable using **SAS in regulated or industry-standard environments**, particularly for data manipulation, statistical analysis, and reporting.

**Key technical strengths include:**
- Regression modeling and statistical inference  
- Longitudinal and real-world data analysis  
- Data wrangling and validation  
- Reproducible analysis pipelines and clear reporting  


## Career Interests

I am actively seeking **industry-oriented roles** in **biostatistics, data analytics, and quantitative research**, particularly within **pharmaceuticals, healthcare, life sciences, and consulting**. I thrive in collaborative environments and enjoy applying statistical methods to solve real-world problems.
