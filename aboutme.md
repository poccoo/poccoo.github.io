title: About me
Columbia University Biostat Grat
---

I am a Biostatistics graduate student with strong training in statistical modeling, longitudinal data analysis, and real-world clinical research. I am currently pursuing a **Master of Science in Biostatistics (Theory and Methods Track)** at **Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health**, with an expected graduation in **May 2026**.

My academic and research interests lie at the intersection of **biostatistics, clinical data analysis, and biomedical research**, with hands-on experience working with large-scale neuroimaging, transcriptomic, and real-world datasets.

## Research & Professional Background

I am currently a **Research Assistant** in the **Neuroimaging Working Group (LeeLab)** at Columbia University / NYSPI, where I work on **resting-state fMRI functional connectivity analysis in Alzheimer’s disease**. My work focuses on:

- Longitudinal and repeated-measures modeling using **mixed-effects models**  
- Mediation and interaction analysis with **quasi-Bayesian simulations**
- Reproducible statistical workflows in **R**
- Translating statistical results into clinically meaningful insights

Previously, I conducted large-scale **meta-analyses of transcriptomic data** across human and mouse Alzheimer’s disease datasets, applying advanced co-expression network methods and cross-species comparisons. I have also gained industry experience through internships in **healthcare consulting (IQVIA)** and **financial data analysis**, strengthening my ability to work with real-world, business-oriented datasets.


## Technical Skills & Certification

I am proficient in **R, Python, and SQL**, with applied experience in statistical modeling, data visualization, and reproducible research pipelines.  
Importantly, I hold **SAS Base and SAS Advanced Certifications**, and I am comfortable working in **SAS, R, and Python** across academic and industry settings.

**Key skills include:**
- Regression modeling and statistical inference  
- Survival analysis and longitudinal data analysis  
- Clinical and real-world data analysis  
- Reproducible research and data visualization
