About Me
I am a Biostatistics graduate student with strong applied training in statistical modeling, real-world data analysis, and programming, along with a solid foundation in biological sciences. I am seeking roles across biostatistics, data analysis, biology field research, and laboratory technician positions that value both quantitative and experimental skills.

I am currently pursuing a Master of Science in Biostatistics (Theory and Methods Track) at the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health, with an expected graduation in May 2026.

My background combines rigorous statistical theory with hands-on experience working on large, real-world datasets, as well as formal coursework and practical training in biology and laboratory research. Although my primary degree is not in biology, I completed extensive undergraduate coursework in molecular biology, physiology, and molecular genetics, alongside corresponding biology and organic chemistry laboratory training, and have worked directly in wet-lab research environments.

Industry & Applied Experience

I currently work as a Research Assistant at Columbia University / NYSPI, where I analyze large-scale neuroimaging and clinical datasets related to Alzheimer’s disease. My role emphasizes applied statistical analysis and reproducible workflows, including:
 • Regression and mixed-effects models for longitudinal and repeated-measures data
 • Mediation and interaction analysis using simulation-based inference
 • Data cleaning, transformation, and analysis in R and Python
 • Communicating statistical findings to multidisciplinary teams

Previously, I worked as a Laboratory Assistant at the Food Science and Processing Research Center, Shenzhen University, where I gained hands-on wet-lab experience. My work included improving soybean protein extraction protocols and conducting comparative protein analysis using Ion Exchange HPLC (IEX-HPLC), reinforcing my familiarity with experimental design, data collection, and laboratory workflows.

In addition to academic research, I have gained industry exposure through healthcare consulting (IQVIA) and data-focused roles, working with structured, real-world datasets under practical constraints such as data quality, timelines, and stakeholder needs.

Technical Skills & Certification

I have experience across both dry-lab and wet-lab settings. On the computational side, I am proficient in R, Python, SQL, and SAS, and can build end-to-end analytical workflows from raw data to reporting and visualization.

I hold both SAS Base and SAS Advanced Certifications and am comfortable working in regulated or industry-standard environments.

Key strengths include:
 • Statistical modeling and inference
 • Longitudinal and real-world data analysis
 • Biological data interpretation
 • Laboratory data collection and validation
 • Reproducible analysis and clear reporting

Career Interests

I am actively seeking roles in biostatistics, data analytics, biology field research, and laboratory technician positions, particularly within pharmaceuticals, healthcare, life sciences, and academic or translational research settings. I enjoy collaborative environments and working at the interface of data analysis and biological research.
