## 1. Introduction {#introduction}

### 1.1 Background {#background}

Alopecia areata (AA) is a chronic, immune-mediated disorder characterized by non-scarring hair loss, most commonly affecting the scalp (Lepe & Zito, 2024). With an estimated prevalence of approximately 0.27% in China alone, AA affects millions of people globally and is associated with considerable psychosocial burden, particularly among adolescents and young adults with severe disease (Wang et al., 2023).

The pathogenesis of AA involves autoimmune targeting of hair follicles, with cytokine signaling through the Janus kinase (JAK) pathways—particularly JAK1 and JAK2—playing a central role in disease progression (Yamaoka et al., 2004).

Baricitinib is an oral selective JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor. It has demonstrated efficacy in two large, randomized Phase 3 trials—BRAVE-AA1 and BRAVE-AA2—by significantly increasing the proportion of patients achieving meaningful scalp hair regrowth (SALT ≤ 20) after 36 weeks of treatment (King et al., 2022).

Since its approval for AA treatment in several countries, including China, baricitinib has represented a shift in the treatment paradigm, particularly for patients who previously relied on systemic corticosteroids associated with long-term safety concerns (Wang et al., 2023). The emergence of JAK inhibitors offers a promising alternative due to their targeted mechanism of action, improved tolerability, and increasing physician preference.


### 1.2 Study Objective

#### Primary Objective

To investigate the efficacy of once-daily oral baricitinib (4 mg and 2 mg) compared with placebo in achieving clinically meaningful scalp hair regrowth in adults with severe alopecia areata after 36 weeks of treatment.

#### Secondary Objectives

To compare baricitinib and placebo with respect to:

- Patient-reported improvement in scalp hair appearance  
- Clinician-rated regrowth of eyebrow and eyelash hair  
- Changes in scalp hair loss severity, measured by percentage change from baseline in SALT score  

#### Safety Objective

To evaluate the safety and tolerability of baricitinib by comparing the incidence and severity of adverse events, treatment discontinuations, and clinically relevant laboratory and vital sign changes over 36 weeks of treatment.



### 1.3 Eligibility Criteria

#### Inclusion Criteria

Participants must be adults: males aged 18–60 years and females aged up to 70 years. Eligible individuals must have severe or very severe alopecia areata, defined as:

- A current disease episode lasting more than 6 months  
- ≥ 50% scalp hair loss, measured by the SALT score at both screening visits  
- No significant spontaneous improvement (≤ 10-point reduction in SALT score) within the previous 6 months  

The current episode must be less than 8 years in duration. Individuals with disease duration ≥ 8 years may still be eligible if they have demonstrated episodes of hair regrowth, either spontaneously or with treatment, during that period.

Participants must agree not to use treatments for alopecia areata during the study period. Prohibited treatments include:

- Systemic therapies (e.g., corticosteroids, methotrexate, cyclosporine, JAK inhibitors, apremilast)  
- Biologic agents (e.g., monoclonal antibodies)  
- Intralesional corticosteroids  
- Topical irritants or immunotherapies (e.g., DPCP)  
- Phototherapy (including laser therapy)  
- Platelet-rich plasma injections  
- Cryotherapy  
- Statins used specifically for alopecia areata  

Permitted exceptions include:

- Bimatoprost for eyelashes, if administered at a stable dose for ≥ 8 weeks prior to randomization  
- Finasteride or minoxidil (oral or topical), if administered at a stable dose for ≥ 12 months prior to baseline and expected to continue through Week 36  

#### Exclusion Criteria {#exclusion-criteria}

Participants will be excluded if they have:

- Diffuse-type alopecia areata with generalized shedding  
- Other forms of hair loss (e.g., androgenetic alopecia, telogen effluvium, trichotillomania, chemotherapy-induced alopecia)  
- Scalp conditions (e.g., psoriasis, tinea capitis) that may interfere with assessment  

Additionally, individuals with unstable medical conditions requiring frequent hospitalization or ongoing systemic immunosuppressive therapy may be excluded at the investigator’s discretion.

Participants will also be excluded if they received any of the following treatments within the specified time windows prior to randomization:

- Topical corticosteroids (scalp or eyebrows): within 1 week  
- Systemic or intralesional corticosteroids: within 8 weeks  
- JAK inhibitors: oral within 8 weeks; topical within 4 weeks  
- Topical immunotherapies: within 4 weeks  
- Monoclonal antibodies: within 5 half-lives  
- Platelet-rich plasma, phototherapy, cryotherapy, or statins for AA: within 4–8 weeks  
- Finasteride or minoxidil: unless stable for ≥ 12 months  
- Other immunosuppressive or targeted therapies: within 4–8 weeks, depending on the agent  

### 1.4 Study Design {#study-design}

This analysis plan describes a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group Phase 3 clinical trial. Participants will be randomized in a 3:2:2 ratio to receive once-daily oral baricitinib 4 mg, baricitinib 2 mg, or placebo for 36 weeks.

Stratified block randomization will be implemented using an Interactive Web Response System (IWRS) (King et al., 2022). Randomization will be stratified by:

- Geographic region (North America vs. Rest of World)  
- Duration of the current alopecia areata episode at baseline:  
  - < 4 years (SALT score 50–94%)  
  - ≥ 4 years or very severe AA (SALT score 95–100%)  

Participants, investigators, and study personnel will remain blinded to treatment allocation throughout the study. Compliance will be assessed via pill counts and patient self-report logs. All statistical analyses will be conducted following database lock to preserve trial integrity.


#### 1.4.1 Sample Size Estimation {#sample-size-estimation}

According to the original JAHO clinical study protocol, approximately 1,035 patients were screened to enroll about 725 participants across Stage 1 and Stage 2 (King et al., 2022). Stage 1 was a dose-finding phase enrolling up to 300 patients, while Stage 2 enrolled approximately 425 patients following interim analysis.

Both BRAVE-AA1 and BRAVE-AA2 trials were designed to achieve 90% power to test the superiority of each baricitinib dose versus placebo for the primary endpoint: the proportion of patients achieving a SALT score ≤ 20 at Week 36. Assumed response rates were 30% for 4 mg, 20% for 2 mg, and 5% for placebo.

Sample size calculations were based on a chi-square test for comparison of two proportions without continuity correction:

n = (Z<sub>1−α/2</sub> + Z<sub>1−β</sub>)² × [p₁(1−p₁) + p₀(1−p₀)] / (p₁ − p₀)²

To account for attrition, noncompliance, and missing data, a 25% inflation factor was applied. Final sample sizes followed the published trial data for consistency: 625 participants for BRAVE-AA1 and 476 participants for BRAVE-AA2 (King et al., 2022).


## 2. Endpoints and Covariates {#endpoints-and-covariates}

### 2.1 Efficacy Endpoints {#efficacy-endpoints}

The primary efficacy endpoint of this trial is the proportion of patients achieving a Severity of Alopecia Tool (SALT) score of 20 or less at Week 36. A SALT score ≤ 20 corresponds to 20% or less scalp hair loss and has been recognized as a clinically meaningful threshold in prior clinical studies (Atanaskova et al., 2024).

Secondary efficacy endpoints include:

1. A Scalp Hair Assessment Patient-Reported Outcome (PRO™) score of 0 or 1 with a decrease of at least 2 points from baseline at Week 36  
2. A clinician-reported outcome (ClinRO™) measure for eyebrow hair loss score of 0 or 1 with a decrease of at least 2 points from baseline at Week 36  
3. Percentage change from baseline in SALT score at Week 36  

These secondary endpoints complement the primary endpoint by incorporating both patient-reported and clinician-assessed perspectives on hair regrowth, providing a more comprehensive evaluation of treatment efficacy.

### 2.2 Safety Endpoints {#safety-endpoints}

Safety assessments will include continuous monitoring and documentation of all adverse events (AEs) reported during the 36-week treatment period. Adverse events include, but are not limited to, death, initial or prolonged hospitalization, life-threatening events, persistent or significant disability, congenital anomalies, or birth defects. Investigators will collect data on the incidence, severity, and relationship of these events to the study drug.

In addition to participant-reported AEs, safety evaluations will be conducted at each study visit by clinical investigators and will include measurement of vital signs and laboratory assessments such as liver enzymes, lipid profiles, and creatine kinase levels. Safety analyses will include all randomized participants who received at least one dose of study medication and had post-baseline safety data available.

---

### 2.3 Covariates {#covariates}

Several covariates will be included in the statistical analyses to adjust for potential confounding factors and improve the precision of treatment effect estimation. These include geographic region, treatment group, baseline SALT score, age group, body mass index (BMI), and duration of the current alopecia areata episode.

These covariates were selected based on clinical relevance. For example, age and BMI are known to influence autoimmune disease progression and may affect treatment response (Lepe et al., 2024). Adjustment for baseline SALT score accounts for disease severity at study entry, ensuring balanced comparisons across treatment groups.

---

## 3. Hypothesis and Decision Rules {#hypothesis-and-decision-rules}

### 3.1 Statistical Hypothesis {#statistical-hypothesis}

The primary null hypothesis (H₀) states that there is no difference in the proportion of patients achieving a SALT score ≤ 20 at Week 36 between each baricitinib dose group (2 mg or 4 mg) and the placebo group.

The alternative hypothesis (H₁) states that a higher proportion of patients in the baricitinib treatment groups will achieve a SALT score ≤ 20 at Week 36 compared with placebo.

Formally, let p₀ denote the proportion of responders in the placebo group, and p₁ and p₂ denote the proportions in the 2 mg and 4 mg baricitinib groups, respectively. Each dose will be compared independently against placebo:

- H₀₁: p₁ = p₀ vs. H₁₁: p₁ > p₀  
- H₀₂: p₂ = p₀ vs. H₁₂: p₂ > p₀  

---

### 3.2 Statistical Decision Rules {#statistical-decision-rules}

Primary hypotheses will be tested at a two-sided significance level of 0.05. The primary endpoint will be analyzed using a logistic regression model adjusted for treatment group, geographic region, baseline SALT score, and duration of the current alopecia areata episode (< 4 years vs. ≥ 4 years). A two-sided p-value < 0.05 will be considered statistically significant.

To control the familywise Type I error rate across primary and key secondary endpoints, a graphical multiple testing procedure will be applied. Each hypothesis will be assigned a portion of the overall alpha level (0.05) and represented as a node within a predefined graph. Upon rejection of a hypothesis, its allocated alpha may be redistributed to other hypotheses according to predefined transition weights. This approach maintains strong control of the Type I error rate while preserving statistical power for clinically important comparisons.

## 4. Analysis Sets {#analysis-sets}

### 4.1 Full Analysis Set {#full-analysis-sets}

The Full Analysis Set (FAS) includes all randomized subjects who were exposed to baricitinib 2 mg or 4 mg and will be analyzed for efficacy through Week 36. Due to blinding, treatment discontinuation decisions for placebo-treated subjects cannot be influenced by knowledge of assigned treatment.

Efficacy analyses will be conducted according to the intention-to-treat (ITT) principle, with subjects analyzed as randomized regardless of protocol deviations or treatment adherence, consistent with ICH E9 Section 5.2.1. Unless otherwise specified, all efficacy endpoints will be analyzed using the ITT population.

---

### 4.2 Safety Analysis Sets {#safety-analysis-sets}

The Safety Analysis Set includes all randomized subjects who received at least one dose of baricitinib or placebo and have available post-baseline safety data. Safety analyses will primarily follow the ITT principle and will be presented in the final manuscript.

An additional per-protocol (PP) safety analysis will be conducted to address clinical concerns regarding drug safety. In this analysis, subjects will be analyzed according to the treatment actually received (“as-treated”). Subjects who received at least one dose of baricitinib will be included in the baricitinib group, while all other subjects will be analyzed as placebo. This approach minimizes the risk of attributing baricitinib-related adverse events to placebo, while acknowledging potential dilution of AE rates.

---

## 5. Handling of Missing Values {#handling-of-missing-values}

Missing data for categorical endpoints will be addressed using multiple imputation with 100 imputed datasets. The imputation model will include treatment group, baseline covariates, and available post-baseline observations.

For continuous outcomes, sensitivity analyses will be conducted using both multiple imputation and a modified last-observation-carried-forward (mLOCF) approach to assess the robustness of results under different missing data assumptions.

---

## 6. Statistical Methodology and Analyses {#statistical-methodology-and-analyses}

### 6.1 Statistical Methods {#statistical-methods}

All statistical analyses will be conducted using SAS Enterprise Guide version 7.12 or equivalent validated statistical software. Efficacy analyses will follow the intention-to-treat principle, while safety analyses will include all subjects who received at least one dose of study treatment and had post-baseline safety follow-up.

**Logistic Regression:**  
The primary endpoint and categorical secondary endpoints will be analyzed using logistic regression models adjusted for treatment group, geographic region, duration of the current alopecia areata episode (< 4 years vs. ≥ 4 years), and baseline values. Model goodness-of-fit will be assessed, with p > 0.05 indicating adequate fit.

**Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA):**  
Continuous efficacy endpoints and continuous safety parameters (e.g., hemoglobin, creatine kinase, LDL, HDL) will be analyzed using ANCOVA models adjusted for treatment group, geographic region, duration of disease, and baseline values.

**Fisher’s Exact Test:**  
Categorical safety outcomes, including adverse events and treatment discontinuations, will be compared between treatment groups using Fisher’s exact test.

---

### 6.2 Statistical Analysis {#statistical-analysis}

Efficacy analyses will be conducted using the ITT population. Safety analyses will include all randomized subjects who received at least one dose of study treatment, regardless of study completion status.

To control the two-sided 5% familywise error rate, multiple comparisons across primary and secondary endpoints will be adjusted using graphical testing procedures. Direct comparisons between the two baricitinib dose groups will not be performed.

---

#### 6.2.1 Primary Analysis {#primary-analysis}

The primary analysis will assess the superiority of each baricitinib dose compared with placebo for the primary endpoint using logistic regression, adjusting for treatment group, geographic region, duration of current alopecia areata episode (< 4 years vs. ≥ 4 years), and baseline SALT score.

---

#### 6.2.2 Secondary Analysis {#secondary-analysis}

Categorical secondary endpoints will be analyzed using logistic regression models with the same covariates as the primary analysis. Continuous secondary endpoints will be analyzed using ANCOVA models. The order of secondary hypothesis testing will follow the predefined graphical testing scheme.

---

#### 6.2.3 Safety Analysis {#safety-analysis}

Adverse events will be coded using a standardized medical dictionary and summarized by treatment group in terms of incidence and severity (mild, moderate, severe). Group comparisons for categorical safety outcomes will be conducted using Fisher’s exact test, while continuous safety parameters will be analyzed using ANCOVA models. Safety data will be summarized over the entire treatment period, and any clinically meaningful imbalances will be reported.
